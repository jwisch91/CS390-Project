What worked:
Weekly meetings, knowing where everyone stood
Short goal ideas kept us goal oriented


What didn't work:
Git directory issues
Lot of new material to learn right away
Too segregated on work, had to wait for one person to finish his functionality.
Breaks, vacations, sick days, other projects/tests


Actions to improve:
Spend more time early learning system
Learn system together
